<h5>Hiya!</h5>
<body>My name is Mohan, I was a software engineer for about 15 years. I did my tertiary education and worked in UK for some time. However, my “Malaysianess” is so strong brought me back to homeland.
Since got back to Malaysia, I have tried few other jobs, but DATA caught my attention. I am very passionate about all things data. My ultimate dream is to become a data scientist.</body>
<p>I am thriving to be become one…</p>
